# Write down a number of hours that you expect each part to take (1-3). Record your hours as you go.

# A GitHub repository.
## Actual time: 10 minutes

# A quality README.
## Actual time: 10 minutes

# A reflection on your estimate. Well? How did you do?
## TBD

# A shell script. Of a curl command to close an issue.
## Estimate: 2 hours
## Actual: TBD

# Primary Task
# Your task tonight is to create a Ruby application which will query multiple API
# endpoints from Github, display a list of current issues, and prompt the user to close one of these issues.
## Estimate: 2 hours

# You will need to create at least two issues on your repo by hand.
## Estimate: 1 hour
### Actual: 5 minutes

# Make sure that your display is easy to read for users. A pile of numbers and
# words with no descriptors won't do anyone any good.
## Estimate: 20 minutes
## Actual: TBD

# Your code must be written in classes and be spread across multiple files. It
# is suggested that you build one class for each API endpoint which you access,
# and then you create instances of each class when you have parameters to make a
# call to that endpoint. If you can think of a better way that still involves classes, though, go for it.
## Estimate: 1 hour
## Actual: TBD

# Testing is going to be tricky on this one. You should mock the API responses
# so that you don't need to hit the API every time you run your tests. You should
# also be able to explain WHY this is good.
## Estimate: 1 hour
## Actual: TBD
